Send start signal to above and begin to poll locations with frequencies of a couple seconds. When this happens, run function that gathers the average of the first three returned points. This is sent to the main view controller which decides which cloud the coordinates belong to (if any). Sidenote: if the user is not within a certain radius of the park at all, present an error message that displays this.
